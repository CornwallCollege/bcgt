Thank you for using the Moodle Grade Tracker Version (BCGT) from Bedford College.

We appreciate your interest and look forward to receiving any feedback you may have. 

For full details about the Grade Tracker project please view the website at http://moodlegrades.bedford.ac.uk. 

INSTALLATION
=============
(please refer to moodle.org wiki for how to install blocks/plugins in general)

* Unzip/unpack the plugin into an empty directory to examine the files and readme.
* Place over the top of the previous version, or perform a fresh install. (To be installed in your blocks directory, put the un-zipped bcgt folder straight under /blocks/)
* With admin rights navigate to Notifications and install as per any block. 

Although we feel it is not necessary, we strongly advise that you do the following before and after any upgrades or installations:

* Perform a test installation/upgrade on a test instance of your Moodle.
* Backup your Moodle database.
* Put your Moodle into 'Maintenance Mode'
* Perform the upgrade/installation
* Purge your cache using the administration/development settings. 
* Take your site out of 'Maintenance Mode' 
 

SYSTEM SETTINGS
===============
There are quite a few plugin settings to configure. Any new ones will appear post upgrade. 

To find all the plugin settings, please navigate to:

SETTINGS > SITE ADMINISTRATION > PLUGINS > BLOCKS > GRADE TRACKER

There is also an admin page with a few other settings that can be changed. 

For full details on the settings please refer to the user guides and http://moodlegrades.bedford.ac.uk for news and updates.
