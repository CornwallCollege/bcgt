This can be created by designers in the form of interactive vector-based animations. Animations of this type are scalable, so they can be resized easily for different screen resolutions from mobile devices to the highest resolution monitors. They are also small in file size, they can stream across the internet even at dial-up modem speeds and all internet users can download a software player that makes viewing their content possible. These characteristics make vector-based animations a popular choice for vibrant web content, and designing such sites is a thriving sector of the interactive media industry.
The unit begins with investigations into web animations, enabling learners to understand the uses of animation on the web. These investigations will cover both visual and technical research. Learners are encouraged to look closely at interactive animations on the web to analyse their design and content. They will also investigate technologies associated with web animation in order to better understand how their work will run on the internet.
Planning a web animation project involves designing, storyboarding and drawing animation content. Learners following this unit will gain experience of planning a web animation project in response to a vocationally relevant client brief. Learners will use vector-based animation software techniques to produce animated interactive content designed for delivery on the internet, and will save and export this animation in a format suitable for the web.
This unit will also develop learners’ ability to reflect critically on their own work, as they will need this professional skill in any future career."

Whether advertising an event or a product, information graphics should be visually stimulating as well as informative.
In this unit learners will produce outcomes for information graphics applications through assignment briefs which have similar constraints to those expected in a real work situation. These constraints, often set by a client, include deadlines, cost issues, specific design approaches and possible legal and ethical issues such as copyright and designing work to be inclusive to all.
Learners will investigate the design contexts of a brief such as target audience, the product, the message and the media in which it will be presented. During these investigations learners will be encouraged to make changes to existing thinking by exploiting their own new and imaginative ideas.
A design methodology should be taught and applied to this discipline to highlight the key stages of the design process. Learners will develop skills in planning and good time management in order to meet deadlines and recognise the need for regular evaluation and review of work in progress in order to meet the requirements of the assignment brief.
This unit will also help learners develop valuable presentation skills as they will be expected to present their work in a manner suitable for the design outcome of this brief, such as portfolio presentation, mounted examples of work, formal presentation or critique."

As a result of reviewing their work,
they will be able to identify and use automated methods or alternative ways of working to improve productivity.

An activity will typically be ‘straightforward or routine’ because:
 - the task or context will be familiar and involve few factors (for example,
time available, audience needs, message, structure); and

- the techniques used will be familiar or commonly undertaken.


This unit is mandatory for the Certificate and Diploma at Level 1."
